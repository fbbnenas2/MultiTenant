Apart from the default `dataSource`, we configure two additional data sources
`audi` and `ford` for each of the tenants:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=dataSources]
----

The names of the data sources correspond to the tenant ids that the configured `TenantResolver` should return.

TIP: If the default data source can also be considered a tenant then the value of `ConnectionSources.DEFAULT` should be returned as the tenant id.
